       <h3>[Love is more thicker than forget]</h3> 
        <p>
            "Love is more thicker than forget <br />
            More thinner than recall<br />
            More seldom than a wave is wet<br />
            More frequent than to fail"<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            "It is most mad and moonly<br />
            And less it shall unbe<br />
            Than all the sea which only<br />
            Is deeper than the sea"<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            "Love is less always than to win<br />
            Less never than alive<br />
            Less bigger than the least begin<br />
            Less littler than forgive"<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is most sane and sunly<br />
            And more it cannot die<br />
            Than all the sky which only<br />
            Is higher than the sky"<br />
        </p>
